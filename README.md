# CargoTrackAI
The goal of CargoTrackAI is to demonstrate how deep learning-based object detection can be integrated into a structured counting system using rule-based motion analysis.  This project showcases practical implementation of computer vision for automated monitoring scenarios using optimized inference pipelines in Python.
